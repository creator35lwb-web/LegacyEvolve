## Methodology Attribution

### VerifiMind-PEAS

The core idea for this project was validated using the **VerifiMind-PEAS X-Z-CS RefleXion Trinity** methodology. This framework ensures that ideas are validated from multiple perspectives—innovation, ethics, and security—before development begins.

## Inspiration and Research

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The LegacyEvolve Protocol is directly inspired by the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** developed by Anthropic. MCP provides a standardized way for AI agents to connect to modern tools, and LEP extends this concept to legacy systems.
