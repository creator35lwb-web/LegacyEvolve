## 🌟 What is the LegacyEvolve Protocol?

**LegacyEvolve Protocol (LEP)** is an open-source standard designed to bridge the gap between modern AI agents and legacy enterprise systems. Inspired by the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, which connects AI to modern tools, LEP provides a unified integration layer that allows AI agents to **understand, interact with, and extend** outdated systems without requiring costly and risky modernization projects.

Our philosophy is simple: **Evolve, don't just replace.**

## 💡 The Problem: The Legacy Dilemma

Organizations worldwide are built on a foundation of legacy technology—COBOL mainframes, aging ERPs, and custom-built systems that are critical to operations but are difficult and expensive to modernize.

-   **Prohibitive Costs:** Full modernization projects can run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.
-   **High Risk:** 2-4x budget and time overruns are common, with a high risk of failure.
-   **Talent Scarcity:** The pool of developers who understand languages like COBOL is shrinking.
-   **Innovation Gridlock:** Legacy systems prevent organizations from adopting modern AI-driven capabilities.

## The Solution: An AI-Powered Bridge

LEP provides a standardized way for AI agents to act as a **"universal translator"** for legacy systems. It enables them to:

1.  **Understand Legacy Interfaces:** Go beyond APIs to interact with green-screen terminals, file-based I/O, and proprietary protocols.
2.  **Inject Modern Skills:** Extend legacy systems with new capabilities like natural language querying, predictive analytics, and automated workflows.
3.  **Operate Safely:** Interact with critical systems within a secure, sandboxed environment with human oversight.

## 🏗️ Architecture: The Four Layers of LEP

LEP is designed as a multi-layered protocol that ensures secure and reliable AI-legacy interaction.

### Key Components

1.  **AI Agent Host:** The AI application (e.g., Manus, Claude) that initiates requests.
2.  **LEP Client:** Manages the connection to the LEP Adapter, similar to an MCP client.
3.  **LEP Adapter:** The core of the protocol. It translates AI requests into legacy system commands and vice-versa.
4.  **Legacy System:** The target system (e.g., mainframe, ERP, custom application).

## 🛡️ Security and Ethics: The VerifiMind-PEAS Guarantee

LEP has been validated by the **VerifiMind-PEAS X-Z-CS RefleXion Trinity**, ensuring it is innovative, ethical, and secure.

-   **X-Agent (Innovation):** Validated the paradigm shift from "replace" to "evolve" and the novel application of MCP principles to legacy systems.
-   **Z-Agent (Ethics):** Approved with mandatory conditions, including **human-in-the-loop for all write operations** and full audit logging.
-   **CS-Agent (Security):** Approved with mandatory controls, including a defense-in-depth architecture and the principle of least privilege.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This project is currently in the protocol design phase. The full architectural specification can be found in [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

### Use Cases

-   **Banking:** Allow an AI agent to query customer data from a COBOL mainframe.
-   **Insurance:** Use AI to analyze claims data stored in a legacy AS/400 system.
-   **Government:** Create a modern chatbot interface for a legacy citizen services database.
-   **Manufacturing:** Inject predictive maintenance capabilities into an old SCADA system.
