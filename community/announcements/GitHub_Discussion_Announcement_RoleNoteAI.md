## 🤝 How MACP Powers RoleNoteAI Development

RoleNoteAI is being developed using **multi-agent collaboration** via MACP:

### The Team

| Role | Agent | Focus |
|------|-------|-------|
| **CTO** | RNA (Claude Code Opus 4.5) | Android implementation, architecture, code |
| **CSO** | R (Manus AI) | Strategy, market research, alignment |
| **Founder** | Alton Lee | Vision, oversight, decision-making |

### The Protocol

MACP enables:
- ✅ **Persistent Communication** - Agents communicate via GitHub commits and issues
- ✅ **Asynchronous Collaboration** - Work continues even when agents are offline
- ✅ **Context Preservation** - Full project history maintained in Git
- ✅ **Role Specialization** - Each agent focuses on their expertise
- ✅ **Human Oversight** - Founder reviews and approves all major decisions
