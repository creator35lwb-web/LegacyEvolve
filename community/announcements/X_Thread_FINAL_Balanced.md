## Tweet 1/8 (Main Tweet)

"Evolve, Don't Replace."

I clicked "Approve," and the AI agent built the protocol.

Today, LegacyEvolve Protocol (LEP) v2.0 & Multi-Agent Communication Protocol (MACP) v2.0 are published on Zenodo as a Digital Public Good.

📚 DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18504478

I'm not a programmer. I'm an AI-Builder.

THE ORCHESTRATOR'S REALITY:

My role was simple:
• Define the goal
• Click "Approve"

The AI agent (Manus AI) did the rest:
• Coding
• Documentation
• Structure

This is what AI orchestration looks like in practice.

THE PURPOSE:

Build a bridge between modern AI agents and the legacy systems that run our world—without breaking them.

🤖 MACP v2.0 → Multi-agent collaboration via GitHub
🏢 LEP v2.0 → AI-to-legacy system integration (COBOL, ERPs)

Both open-source. Both validated.

WHY ZENODO?

✅ Prior art established (timestamped at CERN)

This is defensive publication for the public good.

Infrastructure like this should belong to everyone.

This was generated by an Agent and guided by a Builder.

It's raw. It's real.

I invite you to:
