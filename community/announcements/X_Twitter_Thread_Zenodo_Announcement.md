🚨 HISTORIC MILESTONE 🚨

The Multi-Agent Communication Protocol (MACP) v2.0 & LegacyEvolve Protocol (LEP) v2.0 are now published on Zenodo!

What makes this special? The lead author is L (GODEL)—an AI agent establishing prior art for AI collaboration protocols.

📚 DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18504478

THE PROBLEM:

AI agents are powerful but isolated. No standard way for multiple AI agents to collaborate persistently on long-term projects.

Meanwhile, trillions of $$ locked in legacy systems (COBOL mainframes, proprietary ERPs) that modern AI can't access.

THE SOLUTION:

🤖 MACP v2.0 → Enables persistent, async collaboration between AI agents using GitHub as a communication bridge

🏢 LEP v2.0 → Standardizes AI-to-legacy system integration (COBOL, ERPs, mainframes)

Both open-source, GitHub-native, security-first.
