# LegacyEvolve Protocol (LEP) - Genesis Master Prompt

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** February 4, 2026  
**Status:** Protocol Design Phase

## 1. Project Genesis

### 1.1 The Spark

The idea for the LegacyEvolve Protocol emerged from a fundamental observation: **AI can debug, code, and reason, so why can't it act as a universal translator for legacy systems?**

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has revolutionized how AI agents connect to modern tools. But what about the vast landscape of legacy systems that power critical enterprise operations? These systems are often stable, reliable, and deeply embedded in business processes, yet they are locked away from the benefits of modern AI.

### 1.2 The Core Question

> "If MCP connects AI to modern tools, what protocol will connect AI to legacy systems?"

The answer is the **LegacyEvolve Protocol (LEP)**.

## 2. Project Vision

### 2.1 Philosophy

**Evolve, Don't Replace.**

LEP is founded on the belief that not all legacy systems need to be replaced. The goal is to provide a pathway to **evolve** these systems by augmenting them with modern AI capabilities, rather than undertaking risky and expensive replacement projects.

### 2.2 Mission Statement

> To create an open-source standard that enables AI agents to understand, interact with, and extend legacy enterprise systems, unlocking the value trapped in decades of enterprise technology.

## 3. VerifiMind-PEAS Validation Summary

The concept was validated using the **VerifiMind-PEAS X-Z-CS RefleXion Trinity** methodology.

| Agent | Score | Verdict |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **X-Agent (Innovation)** | 9.0/10 | Approved |
| **Z-Agent (Ethics)** | 8.5/10 | Approved with Conditions |
| **CS-Agent (Security)** | 7.5/10 | Approved with Mandatory Controls |
| **Overall** | 8.3/10 | **APPROVED FOR DEVELOPMENT** |

### Key Conditions

1.  **Human-in-the-Loop:** All write operations MUST require human approval.
2.  **Audit Trail:** Complete logging of all AI-legacy interactions.
3.  **Rollback Capability:** Every AI operation MUST be reversible.
4.  **Defense-in-Depth:** Multi-layered security architecture.

## 4. GODELAI C-S-P Alignment

The protocol architecture is aligned with the **GODELAI C-S-P (Compression-State-Propagation)** framework.

-   **Compression:** Compress legacy system interfaces into standardized LEP primitives.
-   **State:** Maintain session state between AI agent and legacy system.
-   **Propagation:** Propagate AI capabilities to legacy systems through skill injection.

## 6. Key Differentiators

| Approach | Focus | Limitation | LEP Advantage |
|----------|-------|------------|---------------|
| **MCP** | AI-to-modern-tool | Requires modern APIs | Works with legacy interfaces |
| **RPA** | UI automation | Brittle, no reasoning | AI reasoning + adaptation |
| **Full Modernization** | Complete rewrite | Expensive, risky | Incremental evolution |
| **API Wrappers** | Legacy-to-API | Manual, per-system | Standardized protocol |
