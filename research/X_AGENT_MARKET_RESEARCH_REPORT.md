### Executive Summary

This report validates the market opportunity for the **LegacyEvolve Protocol (LEP)**, an open-source standard for connecting AI agents to legacy enterprise systems. The research confirms a **strong and urgent market need** for a solution that can bridge the gap between modern AI and the decades of technology that still power global enterprises.

The legacy modernization market is a **$25 billion+ industry** growing at a robust **17.9% CAGR** [1]. The single biggest driver of this growth is the rise of **Generative AI**, which is expected to boost the market's CAGR by **+4.3%** over the medium term [2]. This creates a perfect storm for LEP, which is designed to be the essential protocol for AI-driven legacy evolution.

While the competitive landscape includes major players like IBM, Accenture, and Microsoft, they are primarily focused on **code conversion and full modernization projects**. LEP's unique value proposition is that it **complements, rather than competes with, existing solutions** by providing a standardized protocol for AI-legacy interaction. This is a **clear market gap** that LEP is perfectly positioned to fill.

The technical feasibility of LEP is **proven** by existing open-source projects like **Azure's Legacy Modernization Agents** [3] and **legacy-use** [4], which demonstrate that AI can successfully interact with legacy systems via code analysis and screen automation. Furthermore, the growing adoption of the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** [5] creates a ready-made ecosystem for LEP to integrate with.

**The strategic recommendation of this report is to PROCEED WITH DEVELOPMENT.** The market is ready, the technology is feasible, and the competitive landscape is favorable. LEP has the potential to become the **de facto standard for AI-legacy integration**, unlocking trillions of dollars in value trapped in legacy systems.

### 1. Market Size and Opportunity

The global legacy modernization market is a large and rapidly growing industry. According to Mordor Intelligence, the market is expected to reach **$29.39 billion in 2026**, up from $24.98 billion in 2025, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of **17.9%** through 2030 [1, 6].

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Market Size (2025)** | $24.98 billion | [1] |
| **Market Size (2026)** | $29.39 billion | [1] |
| **Market Size (2030)** | $56.87 billion | [6] |
| **CAGR (2025-2030)** | 17.9% | [1, 6] |

#### 1.1 Key Market Drivers

The growth of the legacy modernization market is driven by several key factors, with the rise of Generative AI being the most significant.

| Driver | Impact on CAGR | Timeline |
|---|---|---|
| **GenAI-assisted code conversion** | +4.3% | Medium term (2-4 years) |
| **Cloud-native agility imperative** | +3.2% | Medium term (2-4 years) |
| **Rising technical debt (COBOL/mainframes)** | +2.8% | Long term (≥4 years) |

**Key Insight:** The fact that GenAI is the #1 market driver provides strong validation for the LEP concept, which is fundamentally about enabling AI to interact with legacy systems.

#### 1.2 Key Market Restraints

The primary restraints on the market are the high up-front costs of modernization and the scarcity of legacy-language specialists. LEP directly addresses both of these challenges.

| Restraint | Impact on CAGR | Timeline |
|---|---|---|
| **Up-front migration cost and risk** | -2.1% | Short term |
| **Scarcity of legacy-language specialists** | -1.8% | Long term |

**Key Insight:** LEP's "Evolve, Don't Replace" philosophy reduces up-front costs, and its AI-driven approach mitigates the talent shortage, turning a market restraint into a strategic opportunity.

### 2. Competitive Landscape

The competitive landscape for legacy modernization is crowded, but no company is offering a standardized protocol for AI-legacy integration. This leaves a significant gap in the market for LEP.

#### 2.1 Top AI-Driven Legacy Modernization Platforms

| Rank | Platform | Focus | Key Strength |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Stride 100x** | .NET modernization | GenAI + human oversight, 87% faster |
| 2 | **Rhino.ai** | Speed-first migration | Agentic AI, modular agents |
| 3 | **OpenLegacy** | API generation | Visual dependency mapping, IBM/mainframe focus |
| 4 | **IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Z** | COBOL-to-Java | GenAI code suggestions, mainframe expertise |
| 5 | **AWS Transform** | Mainframe-to-cloud | AI agents, years-to-months acceleration |

#### 2.2 LEP's Unique Value Proposition

LEP is not a direct competitor to these platforms. Instead, it is a **complementary protocol** that can be used by all of them to standardize their AI-legacy interactions.

| Aspect | MCP | LEP |
|---|---|---|
| **Target Systems** | Modern APIs, cloud services | Legacy mainframes, COBOL, ERPs |
| **Interface Type** | REST APIs, webhooks | 3270 terminals, file I/O, proprietary protocols |
| **Philosophy** | Connect to modern tools | Evolve legacy systems |

### 4. Strategic Recommendations

Based on this research, the following strategic recommendations are proposed:

1.  **PROCEED WITH DEVELOPMENT:** The market opportunity is clear, and the timing is right.
2.  **Position as an MCP Extension:** Frame LEP as the natural extension of MCP for the legacy world.
3.  **Target Insurance and Banking First:** These industries have the highest density of legacy systems and have already shown a willingness to adopt MCP.
4.  **Focus on Read Operations Initially:** This will lower the barrier to adoption and reduce perceived risk.
5.  **Build a Strong Open Source Community:** Partner with existing communities around MCP, Semantic Kernel, and legacy modernization.
